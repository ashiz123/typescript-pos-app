-----TDD-Driven POS Engine-----(ONGOING NOW)

A professional-grade Point of Sale (POS) backend architected with TypeScript and a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) philosophy. This project serves as a deep dive into scalable architecture, focusing on data integrity, real-time session management, and automated infrastructure testing.

-----Tech Stack------
Category	Technology
Language	TypeScript
Runtime	  Node.js / Express
Database	MongoDB (Mongoose)
Caching	  Redis (Session Management)
Container Docker
Testing	  Vitest, Supertest
Patterns	Repository Pattern, Base Classes, Feature-Driven Design, MVC


-----Architecture & Design Patterns-----
The project follows a Feature-Based Architecture, ensuring that each domain (Auth, Product, Sales) is self-contained yet benefits from shared infrastructure.

Shared Base Layer: High code reusability via shared/ classes like BaseService,CrudRoute, CrudRepository, and BaseModel.
Layered Responsibility:

Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
Services: Execute core business logic.
Repositories: Abstract database operations (Mongoose).
Validations: Strict schema enforcement using Joi/Zod.
Centralized Error Handling: Custom httpErrors and guard system to manage application flow and prevent "nasty" crashes.
Logging : Winston logger
